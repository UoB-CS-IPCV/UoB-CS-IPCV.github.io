          <h2>About</h2> 
          <p>Image Processing and Computer Vision (<a href='https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=22%2F23&unitCode=COMS30030'>COMS30030</a>) consists of online video lectures and in-person Q&As. Additionally, there are in-person labs for those (registered on <a href='https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMS30068'>COMS30068</a>) who have elected to be assessed by Coursework. Those who have elected to be assessed by Exam (and so registered on <a href='https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMS30032'>COMS30032</a>) are welcome to drop-in on the LABS subject to restrictions as we are logistically prepared with enough resources to handle those officially registered for labs.  </p>

<p>The unit aims at providing a first theoretical and practical introduction to classical computational vision: the theory, principles, techniques, algorithms and applications. The unit is structured in terms of topics. For each topic, we cover the underlying theory in lectures, important algorithms and example applications in Q&A sessions, and the practical challenges in labs. This is an introductory unit and will not explicitly discuss deep learning aspects of Computer Vision - these are covered in the 4th year unit COMSM0045: Applied Deep Learning. </p>

<p>Lectures will introduce a topic and identify the key theory, challenges and applications. Students are expected to follow this up with self study based on a problem sheet, revision and further reading. The problem sheet will be worked on in the Q&A sessions where students will be expected to contribute to the discussion and suggest solutions directed by a member of the teaching team.</p>

<p>Labs for Coursework Assessment students only: During labs, students will implement algorithms and experimenting with them, e.g. evaluating their performance. Students are expected to prepare for lab sessions by studying the relevant theory and implementation challenges, and coming up with prototype designs. Implementation will be done using OpenCV. The lab sessions will be run in small groups by postgraduate students working in the field of image processing and computer vision. As well as helping you with designs and implementations, we will also use these sessions to help you explore wider aspects and applications of the current topic. The work done in the formative labs will then lead to the unit's coursework which includes a brief report.</p>

          <p>The unit is not taught strictly along the lines of a textbook. However, often it is useful to cover a topic again from a different angle and textbooks can be helpful tools for this. Here are two examples of many books that go well beyond what we cover in this unit: <a href='https://www.imageprocessingplace.com/'>IP Place</a> and <a href='http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/CV2E-site/cv2eindex.html'>CV2ed</a>. Luckily, issues you might have on the topics covered in this unit, that you might look for in a book, are likely to be answered directly by looking things up on the web or by searching across programmer forums.</p>
